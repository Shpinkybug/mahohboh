					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mahohboh.org/about-the-culling-of-elephants-in-botswana/#comment-36880&quot;&gt;Carin Harrington&lt;/a&gt;.

Carin,

You should not look at this problem as an &#039;elephant problem&#039; but rather as &#039;national park problem&#039;.  The principle conservation-objective of a national park is to &quot;maintain species diversity&quot; (That is, species diversity of both plants and animals).  If you want to know more about this problem may I suggest that you purchase a copy of my book: &quot;ELEPHANT CONSERVATION - The Facts and Fiction.&quot;  It costs just 300 South African Rands (approx./ US$ 20).  All your questions are answered in that book. 

Global warming (by man) is a myth. Human population explosion is real.  We can only deal with the truth - with the facts.  And when too many elephants destroy the habitats in a national park, they also cause the extinction of the plants and the animals that depend on those habitats.   Sure you can change wildlife management practices to anything you like, but the PRINCIPLES of wildlife management are immutable.  THEY cannot be changed - not even by one little inch.  And wildlife management practices are determined by those principles.  In southern Africa we have no elephant poaching problem (at least poaching is not adversely affecting our elephant populations).  Just understand that  the countries of southern Africa would be quite happy to provide elephants to anybody who wants them - but the recipient countries will have to find the money to move them (and the costs are very high). In southern Africa our elephant populations are between 10 and 20 TIMES too many  - and OUR concerns are NOT about saving a few elephants.  Our concerns are more about how we an save our national parks - which the elephants are turning into deserts.

We have the best of the world&#039;s elephant management expertise in southern Africa. We don&#039;t have to get anybody else to tell us how to manage our elephants.  And we will be prepared to move as many of them that you would like to move - to where ever.  But we cannot wait indefinitely.  We have to start killing elephants en masse - and soon - if we are to save our national parks; if we are to save the plants (habitats) in our national parks; and if we are to save all the other animals species that live in our national parks, too.  Our FAR TOO MANY elephants are killing everything.   

CITES is a tragic enemy of wildlife in Africa.  THAT FACT TOO is discussed in the book.  CITES should be dissolved and done away with.  Africa and its wildlife is damaged more by CITES than by any other factor.  

We have the &quot;correct teams of scientists&quot; - many times over in fact - who can make our &#039;realistic&#039; dreams come true.  &quot;Moving&quot; elephants, however, is not the problem.  That fact that there are too many elephants is the problem.  And the ONLY solution is to reduce their numbers to a level that their habitats can sustainably support them.

I would recommend that you procure a copy of the book I have recommended. AND/OR, maybe also, the book: &quot;Managing our Wildlife Heritage&quot; (R100 = &lt;US$ 6).

With kind regards

					<description><![CDATA[I see the problem and respect the dilemma. I too have spent my career with wildlife but in conservation biology with endangered species. The Botswana problem is very sad.
The author has long experience and expertise, but in this world of encroaching global warming and human population explosion, can&#039;t we look at changing the established wildlife management practices.
Why save elephants against poaching and in some African Countries they also say they have too few elephants.

I realise CITES in August is prohibiting the sale of elephants outside Africa. 
Harness the people who want to contribute. If the world would financially support the plan, can the elephants be moved within Africa or even globally. Both Brazil and China are offering land masses for elephant translocation. With the correct team of scientists, vets and animal carers, is trophic rewilding possible or just a dream???

Thank you

					<description><![CDATA[My own experience, based on studying global dryland issues, and based on 10 years living in Africa, 5 years in India, and many more years visiting both, often involving game viewing or associations with funding wildlife projects, suggests a few key principles (many mentioned in these threads): 

1. in the elephant dilemma, the objective must be to ensure viable ecosystems, including soils, flora and fauna (including elephants), in a hundred and two hundred years. 
2. We know from research and from experienced observation, that elephants damage ecosystems massively when their numbers grow beyond the carrying capacity because they do not die off soon enough during high population, drought-stressed, episodes. They eat their capital. 
3. the natural dying off of elephants, babies first, is far more cruel than taking a bullet. I think we all know which end we ourselves would choose if vegetation and water had run out. 
4. the level of vegetation and soil destruction during episodes of over-population damage is usually irreversible, every episode is a step down towards desertification and loss of biodiversity. This ecosystem destruction takes with it many thousands of other animals and plants, not just elephants. 5. So far, nobody has offered a realistic and financially feasible alternative to culling to reduce numbers. 
6. All current management plans that claim to be addressing the problem, for example by fiddling with water point management, fencing adjustments, transporting elephants, or opening corridors, while in a few cases of marginal help, are simply kicking the can down the road,  and worse, abetting the building ecosystem destruction. 

So the ball is now in the court of those who disagree with culling to demonstrate an alternative approach to reducing numbers and sustaining ecosystems, including a healthy population of elephants for 200 years. I, for one, would be delighted to hear a workable solution.  Anyone who answers, &quot;I don&#039;t have a solution, but it is not ethical to shoot elephants&quot;, is unethical, and plainly does not care about elephants or sustaining ecosystems.]]></description>

Gilli, I don&#039;t know where you are from. I am from Europe. We have nearly 0 wild animals and have managed to kill the last wolve. So If you believe that human birth control will save wild animals you are wrong. In my country we have only 0,7 children per couple (statistically). And still the animals are dying out. 
A planet without a well balances ecosystem will not work for any animal. If the surplus of wild animals is not killed to have all sorts of them survive...there will be none left. If you have too many birds...there will be no bees.....so there will be NO food for humans. The same is valid for the balance on every single animal. So if you think the killing makes a problem, please find a new planet to move out the humans. Or are you suggesting we shall kill humans to save elephants?
Think about it again!.  Or maybe we should pick up your advice....stick your comment and Mailadress on every single dead person and wait what CITES has as a reply to that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I reside in Botswana and have been visiting Khutse Game reserve once or twice a year since 2012.Was there this past weekend (14 to 17 DEC 2019) and was shocked to see the devastation caused by the elephants that arrived in the park about 2 years ago presumably due to the pressure of overpopulation in the North together with the devastating drought of the past few years. The elephants we saw were mainly adult bulls which were very agitated and aggressive and I fear it is only a matter of time before someone is attacked. We saw 12 elephants at the Molose waterhole and another 7 in Khutse campsite where we were camping. Khutse being in the Kalahari does not have many large trees and these are all being destroyed. Most of the campsites had fairly big camel thorn trees which offered visitors shade from the extreme heat in summer however many of these have been destroyed so tourists will be put off visiting Khutse in future. I also noticed many dead kudu and eland bulls which may or may not be due to destruction of their habitat by elephants. This situation is very real and I fully support the writers veiws.]]></description>

Hello Elizabeth,

You have the exact right understanding and mentality to project science-based wildlife management philosophy in its proper context.  Especially elephant management. Keep at it.  Don’t slacken the pace. We need to “keep at it”. The TGA needs your continued support in this war against the animal rightists. AFRICA needs you. Africa’s people needs your support; and so does Africa’s wildlife.

WELL DONE!
